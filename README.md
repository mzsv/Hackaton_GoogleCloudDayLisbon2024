### Overview

As part of the Google Cloud Day '24 Lisbon Hackathon, our team participated in the challenge themed "Sustentabilidade - Incidentes na Via PÃºblica". The goal of this challenge was to develop an AI-powered solution to automatically detect and report public incidents using video data captured by public transportation buses.

### Problem Statement

Every day, hundreds of public buses operate in the major cities of Portugal. These buses navigate various streets and often encounter incidents such as:
- Accumulation of trash and litter
- Potholes and road surface damage
- Other public nuisances affecting urban sustainability

Currently, reporting these incidents is largely a manual process, which is inefficient and often delayed. Our objective was to create a real-time, automated system to detect and report these incidents, focusing specifically on road potholes.

### Our Solution: Eye on the Asphalt

**Eye on the Asphalt** is an innovative system designed to detect road potholes automatically. This solution leverages video data captured by cameras installed on public buses. Utilizing advanced Google Cloud technologies, our system processes these videos in real time, identifies potholes, and reports them accurately.
